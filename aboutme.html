      <p>
        <strong>Digital Marketer at ArcLab</strong>
      </p>
      <em>Sep 2021 - Present</em>
      <p>
        At ArcLab, we are passionate about building highly targeted and interactive
        forms of bite-sized learning modules on our SaaS platform to upskill blue-collar workers effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my first week, I came out with an integrated marketing campaign for an
        upcoming webinar. I had three weeks to conceptualise, execute publicity and also coordinate panellist speakers. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcBuZ1hqcN4" target="_blank">webinar</a> concluded with the
        attendance of over 30 key industry leaders and leads for the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        My day-to-day responsibilities include optimizing our key landing pages on SEO.
        Revising content in line with SEO trends. Designing collaterals for social media postings. Strategising and coming up with the content calendar and execution. I also do weekly analytics reports to make sure we are in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Specialist Teaching Associate at The Learning Lab</strong>
      </p>
      <em>Oct 2018 - August 2021</em>
      <p>
        Followed my interest in sharing my knowledge, I joined the Education
        industry right out of university. I enjoyed helping my students nurture a lifelong love for learning. In my time in TLL, I put myself in high standards to engage my students in an intellectually simulating way (mostly through jokes) that
        motivates them a passion to excel in school and in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two years in the industry gave me time to think about what I want to do in my professional development and it further deepens my interest in marketing. During the pandemic, I found myself an opportunity to pivot into the start-up world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Digital Marketing Intern at HackerTrail</strong>
      </p>
      <em>Dec 2017 - Jan 2018</em>
      <p>
        My very first taste of working in a startup, I loved the fast-paced nature and responsibilities given -we had to build many things from scratch. All these helped to develop a deep understanding of the business we are in, revenue channels, and
        our customer segments. Together with my team, we drive user acquisition, engagement and retention using various forms of online and offline channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        I managed and monitor the company online presence through its various social media channels. Built and ran social media campaigns that drive our target audience to our landing pages. I conducted market research, write copy for our websites
        and published blog articles focused on tech and career.
